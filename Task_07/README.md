## **What is SPECKit Plus?**

SPECKit Plus is an upgraded, AI-native Spec-Driven Development toolkit built for modern multi-agent systems. Instead of "vibe coding" everything manually, SPECKit Plus forces you to define your **specs**, **architecture**, and **tasks** first, and then lets AI generate consistent, production-ready implementations. It combines structured development (like software engineering blueprints) with AI-powered code generation using tools such as OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP, A2A, Dapr, Kubernetes, and Ray. The result is faster delivery, cleaner architecture, and fewer bugs because the entire system is planned before anything is coded.

# **The 5 Core Concepts**

## **1️⃣ /constitution**

The **/constitution** phase defines the project's principles, rules, boundaries, and quality standards. It acts as the “governing document” of your system, setting the expectations for code quality, architecture, testing, UX guidelines, security, and performance. Everything built later must follow this constitution. It ensures long-term consistency and prevents AI (and developers) from going off-track.

## **2️⃣ /specify**

The **/specify** phase describes _what_ you want to build and _why_, without touching the technical details. It includes user stories, core requirements, scenarios, behaviors, and expected outcomes. This step forces clarity: no guessing, no hidden requirements. It is the blueprint the AI uses to understand the problem before writing any code.

---

## **3️⃣ /plan**

The **/plan** phase converts the specification into a technical architecture. Here you define the tech stack, APIs, data models, system components, workflows, and integration choices. It explains **_how_** the system will be built. This phase is important because AI-generated code becomes consistent, predictable, and aligned with your chosen architecture.

---

## **4️⃣ /tasks**

The **/tasks** phase breaks the technical plan into small, executable tasks that can be completed one by one. This step converts the big architecture into actionable, trackable units like:

- Build X component
- Implement Y API
- Add Z validation
  AI uses this task list to implement features in a clean, structured manner instead of messy vibe coding.

---

## **5️⃣ /implement**

The **/implement** phase is where the AI executes the tasks and generates actual code, files, folders, and modules according to your specs, plan, and guidelines. Because the earlier phases define everything clearly, this step produces predictable, high-quality code instead of random AI-generated guesses.
