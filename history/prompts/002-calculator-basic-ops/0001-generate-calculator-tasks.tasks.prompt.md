## Response

Successfully generated `tasks.md` for the Simple Calculator feature.
The `tasks.md` outlines the implementation steps, organized into phases, including setup, foundational components, user story tasks, and final polish.
Clarifications regarding programming language, parsing technique, floating-point precision, and parentheses support were obtained from the user prior to task generation.

Unfortunately, the Prompt History Record (PHR) could not be automatically created due to a missing template file (`phr-template.prompt.md`). Please ensure the template exists in `.specify/templates/` or `templates/` relative to the project root.
