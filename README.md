# 30-Day AI-Driven Development Challenge

This repository tracks my 30-day journey into **AI-Driven Development**, **AI-Native Development**, and **Spec-Driven Development** — three innovative approaches that are transforming how software is built.

## What I’m Exploring

* **AI-Driven Development:** Writing code with AI as a collaborator, letting AI assist in coding, debugging, and problem-solving.
* **AI-Native Development:** Creating AI agents using AI agents — a meta approach where AI helps design and build other AI systems.
* **Spec-Driven Development:** Focusing on specifications rather than code; AI agents translate your specs into working software.

The ultimate aim? Build entire systems by defining **what** should happen, while AI handles **how** it happens. I orchestrate, AI executes.

## Challenge Schedule

* **Start Date:** November 17, 2025
* **End Date:** December 16, 2025
* **Duration:** 30 days
* **Structure:** 15 tasks, each spanning 2 days

## Objective

Gain mastery over all three development approaches and learn to build systems through AI orchestration instead of manual coding.

## Reference

Following the methodology from the [Panaversity AI-Native Development Book](https://ai-native.panaversity.org/)

## Weekly Focus

* **Week 1:** AI-Driven Development — coding alongside AI agents
* **Week 2:** Spec-Driven Development — writing executable specifications
* **Week 3:** AI-Native Development — creating AI agents with AI
* **Week 4:** Full orchestration — combining all approaches to deliver complete systems

## Tools

* **Specification Management:** SpecKit Plus
* **AI Agents:** Qwen Coder, Gemini CLI
* **Integration & Orchestration:** MCP Servers

## Vision

Transition from writing manual code to orchestrating AI agents that build fully functional systems from well-defined specifications.
